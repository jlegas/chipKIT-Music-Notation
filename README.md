## Synopsis

chipKIT Music Notation is a project for chipKIT Uno32 with chipKIT Basic I/O Shield. It is a music notation and playback system with a graphical user interface and sound output via an external passive piezo-buzzer. There are two implementations of sheet music notation: one using letter notation and another using modern staff notation.
